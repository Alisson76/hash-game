# hash-game
Hash game, just to study and have some fun.

This is intended to be a simple hash game played by two people, where the first choose the line and column of his movement, which is gonna be fullfiled with a x, then the other player and selects his movement and its filed with a o, until the game ends.  
In the future, planning to make this an online game, that's the goal of this whole thing.
